				"As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make an attack with a ranged weapon, otherwise the spell fails. The attack's projectile is {@condition invisible} while in flight and the weapon itself is silent. If the weapon is a firearm, this spell suppresses the smoke and light the weapon produces, making it impossible to see or hear where the shot came from. ",
